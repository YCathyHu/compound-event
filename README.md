# compound-event
An input-output method to assess the economic footprint of a compound event.

Sample_BaseFrTrade_ProSpecialization.m - a sample of Matlab script for the compound scenario when multi-scale floods in reigon C collide with a 30%-24 pandemic control in the global economy with the 'MANR-C' and 'MANR-B' sectors make non-substitutable specialized products.

Sample_DifferExport_ProSpecialization_SpecificGoods.m - a sample of Matlab script for the triple shock of flooding, pandemic control and export restrictions on specific goods with production specialization.

SA_LF_COVID_EXRESr_InventorySize.m - a sample of Matlab script for the sensitivity analysis on the inventory size under the triple scenario of flooding, pandemic control and export restrictions without production specialization.

SA_LF_COVID_EXRESr_InventoryRate.m - a sample of Matlab script for the sensitivity analysis on the inventory restoration rate under the triple scenario of flooding, pandemic control and export restrictions without production specialization.

Figure_DifferExport_ProSpecialization_SpecificGoods.m - a sample of Matlab script for figure drawing on the triple shock of flooding, pandemic control and export restrictions on specific goods with production specialization.
